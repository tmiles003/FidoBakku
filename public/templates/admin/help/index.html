    <h3><i class="fa fa-file-text-o"></i> Evaluations</h3>
    <p>Evaluations are contained in loops, each loop representing a period of evaluation. <br>
      An evaluation is for 1 person, user evaluations are created for each evaluation. The form used 
      is the one set in the Forms section for that user. 
      An evaluation can be in one of 4 modes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>"New" - only Managers &amp; Admins have visibility, while they set up all the user 
        evaluations</li>
      <li><i class="fa fa-file-text fi-blue"></i> "Evaluation" - it's available for the 
        users to complete the user evaluations</li>
      <li><i class="fa fa-comment fi-blue"></i> "Feedback" - it's available to Managers 
        and Admins to do the evaluation feedback</li>
      <li><i class="fa fa-check fi-blue"></i> "Done" - the user can see the completed 
        evaluation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Evaluation mode can be toggled between Evaluation &amp; Feedback on the assignment page. The 
      evaluation is marked complete from the evaluation itself.</p>

    <h3><i class="fa fa-list-alt"></i> Forms</h3>
    <p>Forms are your templates of competencies for rating. Add sections and competencies as you see 
      fit, you can move them up and down, they will keep their order.</p>
    <h4>Shared forms</h4>
    <p>To avoid unnecessary repetition, you can create shared forms. They are re-usable form components 
      that you can prefix to other forms, so for example you could have company-wide competencies, 
      prefixed to team-wide competencies, prefixed to role competencies.</p>
    <h4>Assigned users</h4>
    <p>Users are assigned to a form, it is the form that will be used for their evaluation. <br>
      <em>Only users with an assigned form will be available in the drop-down when you create 
      evaluations.</em></p>
